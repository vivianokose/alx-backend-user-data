# 0x03. User Authentication Service

## Overview

The User Authentication Service provides a secure mechanism for managing user access to applications. It ensures that sensitive information is protected and that only authorized users can access specific functionalities. This README covers the service's features, technology stack, installation process, usage, best practices, and considerations.

## Features

- **User Registration:** 
  - Allows users to create accounts securely.
  - Validates user input and securely stores passwords.

- **Login Functionality:**
  - Authenticates users using their credentials.
  - Implements mechanisms for managing login attempts (e.g., account lockouts).

- **Token-Based Authentication:**
  - Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
  - Supports efficient session management and user verification.

- **Password Reset:**
  - Provides functionality for users to reset their passwords through a secure email verification process.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Manages user roles and permissions.
  - Restricts access to sensitive resources based on user identity and roles.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express.js for building the API.
- **Database:** MongoDB (or a relational database like PostgreSQL) for storing user information.
- **Authentication Libraries:** 
  - `passport.js` for user authentication strategies.
  - `bcrypt` for hashing passwords securely.
- **Token Management:** `jsonwebtoken` for creating and verifying tokens.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-authentication-service
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file with the following content:
     ```plaintext
     PORT=your_port
     DB_URI=your_database_uri
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
     ```

4. **Start the service:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- **Register a New User:**
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/register`
  - **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

- **User Login:**
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/login`
  - **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user",
      "password": "password123"
    }
    ```

- **Password Reset Request:**
  - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/reset-password`
  - **Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com"
    }
    ```

## Best Practices

- **Password Security:** Always hash passwords using `bcrypt` before storing them in the database.
  
- **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers.

- **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement account lockout mechanisms to limit failed login attempts.

- **Input Validation:** Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

- **Regular Updates:** Regularly update libraries and dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The User Authentication Service is essential for securing applications and managing user access effectively. Its robust features protect sensitive user data and ensure that only authorized individuals can access necessary resources. Integrating this service enhances security and fosters trust in your application.
